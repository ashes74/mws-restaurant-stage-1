## Responsive Design

CRITERIA

[x] Is the site UI compatible with a range of display sizes?|

- All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.
- Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.
- An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

[ ] Are images responsive?

- Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.

[x] Are application elements visible and usable in all viewports?

- On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

## Accessibility

CRITERIA

[ ] Are images accessible?

- All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.

[ ] Is focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site?

- Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

[ ] Are site elements defined semantically?

- Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

## Offline Availability

CRITERIA

[ ] Are pages that have been visited available offline?

- When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
